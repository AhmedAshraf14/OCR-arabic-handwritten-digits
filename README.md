# OCR-arabic-handwritten-digits
This repository hosts two projects dedicated to recognizing Arabic handwritten digits using machine learning models â€“ the Decision Tree Classifier and the Random Forest Classifier.

# Introduction
- Decision Tree Classifier:
The Decision Tree Classifier project employs a popular machine learning algorithm to recognize handwritten digits. Trained on a dataset, the classifier leverages decision tree principles to make predictions on unseen data.

- Random Forest Classifier:
The Random Forest Classifier project extends the capabilities of handwritten digit recognition using an ensemble learning approach. Utilizing multiple decision trees, this classifier enhances predictive accuracy and robustness.

# Getting Started
Prerequisites:
Ensure that you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.

# Installation
